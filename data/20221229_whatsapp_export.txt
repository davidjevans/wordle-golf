6/29/22, 6:41 PM - Madre: It's a +4, like 4 over par on a standard golf hole.  I thought I was going to fail. I was worried about my 170 game streak coming to an end. Seriously, GAWKY?  I didn't think that was a word.  After 4 guesses all I had was the a and the y.  Jazzy?  Waggy?  Gawky?  All stupid words!

9/29/22, 12:44 PM - Madre: David and I both thought it was a word and had the same definition..... But I can't find that definition online. 

Paint peeling up in shorts because of moisture or fire underneath, or concrete popping pits.

But i'm thinking Daniel might be on to something
9/29/22, 12:45 PM - Madre: Paint delaminating or lifting in spots...

11/5/22, 2:20 PM - Lisa Burgess: Ugh! Sad!!
11/5/22, 2:21 PM - Madre: This is Daniel's lottery ticket from Xmas. He said it was a $10 winner, but he didn't scratch the multiplier.  I did.  50x. Because he didn't bother, I told him I was keeping half the winning. Simultaneously, David left his in the car unscratched. It was $100. In also kept half of that.  I mean if they're too lazy.....
11/5/22, 2:22 PM - Madre: Last time I tried to call this, the store didn't have enough cash. I tried again today. It's NOT a winner. But I already sent Daniel his $250.  

My sad story.
11/5/22, 2:23 PM - Daniel Evans: Wait so it didn't win??
11/5/22, 2:23 PM - Madre: Daniel had scratched off a 'c' somewhere by mistake.
11/5/22, 2:24 PM - Daniel Evans: Dang.. those tickets remain the worst
11/5/22, 2:24 PM - Madre: Not a winner. Guy in liner behind is knew where to scratch for the secret winning code.  It wasn't there. 

P.S.  that got won $10k on a scratchy last week.

11/13/22, 1:08 PM - Madre: This game accepts words like LARDY and EVITE, but not inate, which in had tried. I was mad and said this game is INANE.  Daniel is right.  Stupid game. Stupid words.

11/13/22, 1:30 PM - Madre: No

Inate
adjective
Common misspelling of innate.

11/23/22, 10:51 AM - Madre: Chowderheads were there. Now I can't remember, either Chowderheads or The Committee beat us by 1, and the other one was notably behind. 

We got both final questions with very little confidence. 

We would have won outright if we didn't let Auntie Gail talk us out of Minnesota as an answer.

Spent the last two days with G&G.  Grampa was in the hospital. They were impressed how strong the 90 year old was when he was punching the nurses.

First word.... DRINK.... Aye-yi-yi.

Grampa is home now.  Tired from his escapades. Grammie is back to nagging him. Status quo maintained.

12/16/22, 2:18 PM - Madre: Usually a two is pretty exciting.
12/16/22, 3:34 PM - Jamie Burgess: OK now I can ask!! Dad why did you get that as your first word?
12/16/22, 3:36 PM - Doug Burgess: No real explanation. I sometimes use plant as my first word, but then probe just sort of came to me.
12/16/22, 3:36 PM - Jamie Burgess: So fun! You really tapped into some flow of the universe there
12/16/22, 3:37 PM - Doug Burgess: Jenifer and Daniel were in the kitchen with me.  I couldn't believe it as the green squares popped up. Neither of them had done it yet.
12/16/22, 3:37 PM - Doug Burgess: But i missed what it says when you get a one i was so excited!
12/16/22, 3:37 PM - Jamie Burgess: 🏆🏅
12/16/22, 3:58 PM - Lisa Burgess: That’s incredible!! Way to go!!
12/16/22, 6:43 PM - Madre: I benefited a little. I had a lucky first word - POWER.  That led to PRO-E.  Knowing your dad got it in one helped me narrow my choices from prone, prove, probe.  He's just not a prone-as-a-first-word guy, and unlikely to use v in his first word. Therefore, I chose probe and scored a two.
12/16/22, 6:44 PM - Lisa Burgess: You both killed it! Very good work
12/16/22, 6:45 PM - Madre: When he got the 1, he yelled Holy Sh..., Jumped out of his chair like he'd been stung.  Daniel and I both looked at him like he was crazy, and he started waving one finger.
