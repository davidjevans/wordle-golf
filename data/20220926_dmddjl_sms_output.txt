[6/2/22 9:44 PM] Lisa Burgess: Wow!!!!

[6/2/22 11:33 PM] Doug Burgess: Holy crap! Last i heard Cs were down by 12 early in the 4th. Just looked and they WON by 12!!!

[6/2/22 11:33 PM] Lisa Burgess: They absolutely crushed in the 4th quarter. Al Horford is a legend!!

[6/2/22 11:34 PM] Daniel Evans: What an awesome comeback

[6/2/22 11:35 PM] Me: Dominant 4th!

[6/2/22 11:35 PM] Me: Was ready to accept another game 1 loss after the 3rd quarter

[6/2/22 11:37 PM] Doug Burgess: Great way to set the stage for a championship series. Game 2 shoukd ve exciting. 😁

[6/2/22 11:37 PM] Lisa Burgess: Same. The Celtics love a third quarter collapse, but dang, that fourth

[6/2/22 11:38 PM] Doug Burgess: Lisa - we know some people who will be at Game 2. 🤔

[6/2/22 11:39 PM] Lisa Burgess: No way?! I'm jealous. I will hopefully be watching on my phone from the calf canyon, but I might miss it all together if we get spiked out again

[6/2/22 11:41 PM] Madre: Just had dinner at Davio's.  Dougie said the Warriors organization called a few days ago and wanted a room one night next week while they're in town, but they're booked. GSW will be going to a Davio's in the Backbay instead.  Bummer.  They missed their opportunity to give them low level food poisoning. Nothing life threatening, you know, just enough to put them a bit of their game.

[6/2/22 11:41 PM] Doug Burgess: Yeah - your bros better at least send some good photos

[6/2/22 11:42 PM] Doug Burgess: From their courtside seats b

[6/2/22 11:42 PM] Lisa Burgess: Hahahaha low level. I'm sad Dougie could accommodate them, but That's awesome about the seats!!!!

[6/2/22 11:43 PM] Madre: When the Celtics meet the Suns in the Finals, we'll cost share with you for your birthday, too.

[6/2/22 11:44 PM] Madre: Courtside seats..... It is on the building so that is courtside compared to the couch on Connecticut Street.

[6/2/22 11:44 PM] Lisa Burgess: Hell yeah!!

[6/13/22 12:59 PM] Lisa Burgess: Incredible! I want your autograph

[6/13/22 1:00 PM] Me: We'll consider hosting a poster signing event later this week.

[6/13/22 1:01 PM] Lisa Burgess: Would you believe that I can't find ONE Boston sports bar in the Phoenix area?

[6/13/22 1:08 PM] Doug Burgess: Sounds like you guys need to up your rude game though compared to the Garden. Warrior whiners.

[6/13/22 1:09 PM] Me: Wow. No Boston bar in Phoenix. That's shocking. You should start one.

[6/13/22 1:09 PM] Me: We'll try better tonight.

[6/13/22 1:11 PM] Madre: D&D live on Connecticut St.  This bar is literally just a few blocks down the hill from their house.

[6/13/22 8:53 PM] Me: Not inside this time

[6/13/22 9:04 PM] Lisa Burgess: LETS GO CELTICS!! I'm watching from Lisa's Boston Sports Bar and wearing my new Larry Bird jersey

[6/13/22 9:34 PM] Doug Burgess: Awesome. No. 33 had always brought me luck and is my racing number!

[6/13/22 9:38 PM] Doug Burgess: Oh sorry - this is not about me. 😁 Go Celts!

[6/13/22 10:54 PM] Madre: Still hanging outside the arena?

[6/13/22 10:54 PM] Me: Still here. An island of green in blue and yellow.

[6/13/22 10:55 PM] Daniel Evans: Yes

[6/13/22 10:55 PM] Lisa Burgess: The Celtics finally have a productive third quarter

[6/13/22 10:56 PM] Madre: Not their traditional 3rd quarter. Keep up the good vibes D&D.

[6/13/22 10:56 PM] Doug Burgess: I fear they're running out of gas.

[6/13/22 10:56 PM] Madre: And Larry....

[6/13/22 10:56 PM] Me: This place going crazy after that poole three

[6/13/22 10:56 PM] Lisa Burgess: D&D, do you guys have any plans to come back to AZ this summer? Maybe the AC will work this time??

[6/13/22 10:57 PM] Me: Lolol. Not yet. Blair just visited, so we owe her one.

[6/13/22 10:57 PM] Lisa Burgess: Poole is burying Curry in terms of incredible 3 point shots this series

[6/13/22 10:57 PM] Madre: That shot was insane.

[6/13/22 10:57 PM] Lisa Burgess: Hopefully it will fall on my days off this year. So far we have had 9 days off in 61 days of fires

[6/13/22 10:58 PM] Lisa Burgess: Or something like that

[6/13/22 10:58 PM] Daniel Evans: Idk if I'm returning to Arizona in the summer

[6/13/22 10:58 PM] Me: The broken AC broke him

[6/13/22 10:59 PM] Lisa Burgess: Hahahahahaha that's fair. November thru April  is much better

[6/13/22 10:59 PM] Doug Burgess: Yowza! I think I've had 9 days off in 61 days of retirement days off

[6/13/22 10:59 PM] Doug Burgess: We're coming in Nov.

[6/13/22 11:00 PM] Lisa Burgess: Wooooo!!!! I'm probably going to lay myself off at the end of fire season again, so I will be free all November!

[6/13/22 11:11 PM] Madre: Poole is a Draymond wanna be except worse cause he can shoot.

[6/13/22 11:11 PM] Lisa Burgess: AGREED

Broke my streak of days in a row, and now broke my 100% solve rate.  And I had a two earlier this week!

Silver lining.... maybe I can find new number patterns in my statistics.

Also looks like Jamie, David, and Doug got the -rite and took guesses, while you, me, and Lisa went the tri-e path.

[7/20/22 12:37 PM] Daniel Evans: Trine and Tride

[7/20/22 12:39 PM] Lisa Burgess: I was sweating on my guesses and I'm usually pretty good with a double letter!

[7/20/22 12:39 PM] Madre: Those crossed my mind.  I was wondering if trine was a word, like a spoke on Poseidon's three pronged spear?

[7/20/22 12:47 PM] Daniel Evans: I think that's tine like a fork. I just typed random words to see what would fit

[7/20/22 12:54 PM] Jamie Burgess: The spear is a trident

[7/20/22 12:55 PM] Madre: The tine of the Trident..... A trine?

[7/20/22 12:56 PM] Daniel Evans: Apparently trine is a one third arc of a circle. And Tride is a pace
