6/29/22, 6:41 PM - Madre: It's a +4, like 4 over par on a standard golf hole.  I thought I was going to fail. I was worried about my 170 game streak coming to an end. Seriously, GAWKY?  I didn't think that was a word.  After 4 guesses all I had was the a and the y.  Jazzy?  Waggy?  Gawky?  All stupid words!
